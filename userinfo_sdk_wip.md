# User information regarding c:geo version 2019.02.23

Dear c:geo users,

you are now using a version of c:geo, which we had to release although some work is still in progress and some known bugs are not yet solved.

Let us explain why we had to do this:
In October 2018 Google changed their requirements for all apps on Google Play. Starting at that time all apps need to target a more recent version of Android, which shall improve security and compatability. While this is a good thing in principle, it required quite some effort on our side to implement these changes and get c:geo basically working again. 
That is also the reason, why you did not see any version updates since last October.

At this moment our small volunteer developer team is still in the progress of cleaning up the code and fixing regressions caused by this forced changes.

Recently the geocaching.com website made some changes, which required an adaption on c:geo side as well. So we had to release a new c:geo version to get you back into the game, although we do not really consider it ready. You might therefore notice, that some aspects of the user interface do not look clean and the app might have some bugs or instabilities.

We will keep on working to fix the remaining drawbacks with subsequent updates as soon as possible.

You can find a list of the identified problems still present in the current version using [this link](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asdk26-regression+).
If you encounter a problem or bug in the new c:geo version which is not yet listed, you can help us by reporting it in our [bugtracker](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/new).

Happy Caching!

The c:geo team
